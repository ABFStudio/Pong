# Pong
This is a Pong game that I have created following a tutorial and I refactored it.

# Windows build
Clone this repo: <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/Pong.git` <br/>
You can either open `PongWindows.sln` and build it with Visual Studio or go to __Release__ -> __PongWindows.exe__. <br/>

# macOS build
Clone this repo: <br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/Pong.git
cd Pong/PongMac
make
chmod +x pong
./pong
``` 
<br/>
Or you can open the `Pong.dmg` installer and drag and drop the app to your Applications folder. <br/>
